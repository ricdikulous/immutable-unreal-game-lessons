# Lesson 1: Course Introduction

## Introduction

Welcome to our course on integrating NFTs into your Unreal Engine game using Immutable's SDK. Today, we embark on a journey to bridge traditional gaming experiences with blockchain technology, enabling a new level of player engagement and reward systems.

## Lesson Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will understand the overall purpose of this course and the key phases involved in integrating NFTs into your game using Immutable's SDK.

## Overview

In this lesson, we will cover the following:

- The purpose and goals of the course.
- Where we are starting: a working Unreal Engine game.
- Where we will end up: a game with NFT integration.
- High-level steps to achieve NFT integration.

## Purpose of the Course

The core purpose of this course is to introduce you to the world of NFTs within the Unreal Engine environment, facilitated by Immutable's Unreal SDK. We aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding and hands-on experience in integrating NFTs into your games, making your games more interactive and enabling new player engagement and reward systems.

## Starting Point

We begin with a working Unreal Engine game, an endless runner where the player collects coins and dodges obstacles. The game is functional but lacks NFT integration.

## End Result

In the finished game, the player will:

- Log in with the Immutable Passport.
- Access an inventory of their NFTs, which represent playable characters with unique stats.
- Select an NFT as their character to play the game.
- Collect coins and avoid obstacles in a runner game.
- Mint a new NFT as a reward for collecting 10 or more coins.

## High-Level Steps

To achieve this integration, we will navigate through several key phases:

1. **Integrating the Immutable SDK into Unreal Engine**: Ensuring a smooth fusion of blockchain technology with your game's mechanics.
2. **Setting Up Backend Components**: Including an S3 bucket for metadata and an ExpressJS server to support NFT minting and retrieving.
3. **Creating a Smart Contract with the Immutable Hub**: Acting as the backbone of our NFTs.
4. **Integrating All Elements Within Your Game**: Resulting in a seamless experience for your players.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll dive into installing the Immutable SDK into Unreal Engine, marking the first step in bringing your NFT-integrated game to life. [**Install the Immutable SDK into Unreal Engine**](../02-install-the-immutable-sdk-into-unreal-engine/README.md)
